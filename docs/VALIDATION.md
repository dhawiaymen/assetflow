# Executed validation

## Baseline

The original published commit had a successful [GitHub Actions run](https://github.com/dhawiaymen/assetflow/actions/runs/40241676012). This was rechecked on 26 October 2026 before changes. No releases existed then.

## Stabilization checks executed locally

- **27 pytest tests passed, zero failures and zero skips**, including Tk GUI checks,
  on Linux / Python 3.12.14 with a virtual display.
- Studio generated-runtime tests execute Node.js. GameTest browser checks execute real
  Playwright 1.51.0 / Chromium 134 headless shell available in the test environment.
- AssetFlow tests were also run against Pillow 13.0.0. The screenshot/demo environment
  uses Pillow 12.3.0. Both results must be distinguished from native Windows results.
- A cross-project integration exported tap/catch/dodge and executed 101 adapter steps
  for each in GameTest; all three scenarios passed.
- pip-audit reported no known advisories for the separately recorded current dependency
  environment, including Playwright 1.64.1 and Pillow 13.0.0.

The current Playwright 1.64.1 browser download was corrupt in this local environment;
no successful local test of that exact new pair is claimed. An attempted mismatched
browser/driver run was abandoned. CI installs the matching version and remains the
release gate. A previous local display setup failed; the final test count above comes
from the subsequent successful displayed run.

## Native Windows and final revision

The workflow attached to this revision runs the OS/Python matrix and extracted-EXE
checks. Consult that run and the release's `windows-verification.json` for the exact
commit, platform, checks and archive digest. A configured workflow is not evidence of
success until its run completes. Manual consumer-desktop/DPI/accessibility testing
remains outstanding.

[Authentic demo](DEMO.md) · [Reproducible benchmark](demo/benchmark.json)

A parallel Windows/Python 3.13 run exposed delayed Tk-variable finalization in an image worker after an earlier workbench was destroyed. The initial release run was cancelled; a regression now checks that destruction releases all owned Tk variables immediately on the UI thread.

The GUI test fixture also explicitly collects destroyed interpreter cycles on the main thread between tests. A missing display is a failure in CI, rather than a skipped GUI check. The production workbench uses one interpreter for its lifetime.
